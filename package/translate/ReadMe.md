Thank you a lot for helping me translate this widget, as the original one has completely wrong translations.

As this menu is supposed to replicate Apple menu, make sure to translate in accordance to https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/whats-in-the-apple-menu-mchlp1130/mac

Before translating, make sure to run `merge.sh` to update/refresh the template.

In order to create a new locale, copy `template.pot` as LANG`.po`, where LANG is an ISO 639-1 code of your language.
Fill out the metadata and translate each `msgid` into `msgstr`. Check uk.po for an example.

After you have finished translating, run `build.sh` to compile your locale. Have a nice day and thank you for contributing ;)
